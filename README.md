## INTRODUCTION

- Project name: HappiNovel
- Project description: HappiNovel is a reading and writing platform where you can read translated versions of all kinds of books in Vietnamese. Moreover, you can also write your own story and share it with everyone. There are 4 main actors: guest (basically they just can read without making comments, rating or writing) - User (they will have more benefits but especially they can write their book) - Moderator and Admin (manage those users and make a censor approval for those books. With Admin, they will have more permission than Moderator).
- Purpose: Nowadays, many Vietnamese want to read novels and books, most of which are not translated into Vietnamese. Besides that, some potential people want to have a platform to publish their books. So there is some demand for reading and writing. That is the reason why our team decided to create a free website for people who want to do this.
